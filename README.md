# releases-js


`pyglvis` uses `esm.sh` as a CDN for `glvis-js`.
`glvis-js` builds are stored in its [repo](https://github.com/GLVis/glvis-js), but are tracked using `git-lfs`, which `esm.sh` has trouble with.


This repo serves as an archive of glvis-js releases similar to [glvis/releases](https://github.com/GLVis/releases), and also a non-lfs location for `pyglvis` to point to.
